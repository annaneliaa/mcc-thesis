"""
CSCAS "full" feature encoder -- the paper's own feature set, as far as the
ingestion pipeline preserves it.

The CSCAS paper (Table IV) trains on 42 raw columns: SignatureID,
SignatureMatchesPerDay, AlertCount, Proto, ExtPort, IntPort, Similarity,
SCAS, and 34 per-attribute *Similarity columns. This encoder reproduces
that set with two unavoidable differences:

  * SignatureID is dropped at ingest (schemas/preprocessing.py keeps it only
    as far as IncomingSuricataGroup -- it's a nominal id, not a signal), so
    it can't be reconstructed here. 41 columns, not 42.
  * SignatureIDSimilarity is carried as its own AlertGroup field
    (`signature_id_similarity`), separate from the 33-entry
    ATTR_SIMILARITY_COLUMNS list, so the "34 *Similarity columns" become
    33 `attr_value:*` + `signature_id_similarity`.

Unlike encoders/baseline.py's `compute_cscas_baseline_features` -- the
deployment-realistic reduced set -- this encoder deliberately includes SCAS
and the offline *Similarity scores. Those come from CSCAS's own offline
similarity pipeline and a real deployment could not compute them for a
fresh alert, so this feature set is a non-deployable *reference ceiling*
for the temporal-decay experiment ("does the frozen model decay even with
the paper's full oracle features?"), not a candidate deployment schema.
